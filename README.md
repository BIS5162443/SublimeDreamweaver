# Dreamweaver + Sublime
Adds the Dreamweaver Color Scheme to Sublime Text 2/3.

Need help transitioning from Dreamweaver's Color Scheme? When I first started using Sublime I had a hard time looking a it's native color schemes. They were hard to read and very incomplete... This adds support for Dreamweaver's special tag specific highlights. For example:

* `<a>`
* `<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, etc...
* `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, etc...

Additional Features:
* PHP highlighting
* JavaScript highlighting
* CSS highlighting

## How to Install

2. Done!

## How to Use
1. Change your Color Scheme to "Dreamweaver" (at: Preferences > Color Scheme > Dreamweaver > Dreamweaver)
2. Create a New File and set your syntax to "HTML (Dreamweaver)" for HTML or "JavaScript (Dreamweaver)" for JavaScript

\* *__Note:__ PHP and CSS do not need a Dreamweaver specific syntax edit.*

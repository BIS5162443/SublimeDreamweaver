Download both folders:

First place the mghDreamweaver folder into your packages folder. This folder is located at:

    (Windows) Data/Packages/
    (Mac) ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/
  
After copying the mghDreamweaver folder to this location, browse the Packages folder and find a folder called HTML and Javascript.

Open up the Language Edits folder bundled with the mghDreamwever folder and copy the respective .tmLanguage files to their appropriate package folders listed above.

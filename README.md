# Dreamweaver + Sublime
Adds the Dreamweaver Color Scheme to Sublime Text 2/3.

Need help transitioning from Dreamweaver's amazing color Scheme? When I first started using Sublime I had a hard time looking a Sublime's native color schemes. They were hard to read and very incomplete... This adds support for Dreamweaver's special tag specific highlights. For example:

* `<a>`
* `<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, etc...
* `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, etc...

In addition, it focuses styling PHP, CSS and JavaScript differently than one another.
